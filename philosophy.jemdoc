- "There is nothing more practical than a good theory." --K. Lewin
	

- "君子生非异也，善假于物也。" --《荀子·劝学》\n
Translation: A man of complete virtue has nothing different in nature but makes the best of available resources.


- Optimizing one's long-term gain is a question of striking the right balance between exploitation and exploration.
