~~~
About [https://www.roboarts.cn/ ARTS]: The Autonomous Robotic Technology Seminar (ARTS) is a technical exchange organization jointly initiated by young scholars and engineers in the field of robotics in China. Its main purpose is to promote exchanges in the field of autonomous robots and promote the integration of academia and business and industry-university-research cooperation. ARTS mainly focuses on sensing and perception, autonomous navigation, state estimation, mobile robot positioning and mapping, motion planning, modeling and control, multi-robot systems and other directions. As a deep and pure technical exchange platform, ARTS advocates *rational criticism, dare to question, and pragmatic scientific spirit, and actively explore free and equal ideological confrontation*.
